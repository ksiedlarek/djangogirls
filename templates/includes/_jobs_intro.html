   Working as a software developer is a great way to become one.
   There are lots of companies out there who are hiring,
   but how can you tell which ones are supportive? Here, you can find offers from companies
   who hire beginners and want to train them. Theyâ€™re not targeting only women,
   but they do care about diversity in the workplace. We trust they do the right thing.
