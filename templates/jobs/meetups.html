                Did you know that Dori, Django Girls alumni from our first event in Berlin,
                got a job because she gave a talk about Django Girls at her local Django meetup in Budapest?
                That’s why your local meetups and user groups can help you make a career in tech.
                Here you can find (or add!) meetups in your city where programmers meet to talk about technology.
                They all have published Code of Conduct, we checked!
            </p>

                On this page we only list meetups and groups that are friendly to beginners
                and have a published Code of Conduct. If you see a meetup that doesn’t meet the requirement,
                please do let us know. We care about you.
