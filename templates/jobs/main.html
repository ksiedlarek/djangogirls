                            Working as a software developer is a great way to become one. There are lots of companies out there who are hiring, but how can you tell which ones are good?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We have talked to a lot of them and here you can find offers from companies who hire beginners and want to train them. They’re not targeting women only, but they do care about diversity in a workplace. We trust they do the right things.

                            Did you know that Dori, a Django Girls alumna from our first event in Berlin, got a job because she gave a talk about Django Girls at her local Django meetup in Budapest?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That’s why it's important to be involved in your local meetups and user groups; they can help you make a career in tech. Here you can find (or add!) meetups in your city where programmers meet to talk about technology.
