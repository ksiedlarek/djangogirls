                Adding a job offer on Django Girls website is free. Yay!
                Our website is visited by many enthusiastic beginner developers and we can help you reach them with your offer.
                However, all the offers listed here need to meet following requirements:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The offer needs to be beginner-friendly - no experience required.</li>
                <li>The offer must not discriminate any gender.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You need to show us that you care about improving diversity.
                We don’t want to recommend to our friends that they work in places that don’t value this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Publishing an offer here is free, however, Django Girls is a non-profit organisation
                with a mission to show more women how amazing programming is. We would appreciate it if you would
