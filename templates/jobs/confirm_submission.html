                <h3>Yay, high-five! Thank you for adding a job offer/meetup.</h3>
                <p> 
                    We carefully review each offer and meetup. We will get in touch with you shortly.

                    Would you help us out too? We donâ€™t charge for helping you reach people who may be interested in your job offer/meetup. However, we are a non-profit organisation with a mission to show more women the joy of programming. Consider making a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/djangogirls">small donation</a> to help us make a larger impact on the world. Thank you!
